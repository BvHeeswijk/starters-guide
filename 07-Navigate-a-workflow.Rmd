# Navigating a workflow
In this section we will walk through the cloned tutorial project on __tercen__. 

You start of on your personal page. We will now navigate to the tutorial __Workflow__ where you can compute your data.

* Click on `Teams`

\ 

* Click on `Tutorial team`
<center><img src="images/Tut_clickonteam.png"></center>
\ 

* Click on `Tutorial project`
<center><img src="images/Tut_clickonproject.png"></center>

You are now on the homepage of the tutorial project. Here you will see:

* The datasets that are uploaded
* The workflows created by your team
* The discussions with your team
* All activities done by your team

\

* Click on `Tutorial workflow`
<center><img src="images/Tut_workflow.png"></center>
\

The workflow is shown. This is the environment where you can visualize and compute your data. It will look like the image below

The "crabs_longformat" is preloaded data, containing information about crabs. 
We performed a __PCA__ on the data using one of our __Operators__. We call this a __data step__.

* Doubleclick on `PCA`

\
You can see that we visualised the data from the crabs_longformat table using heatmap.
The __ PCA operator__ is shown on the left.
The data produced by this __data step__ can be visualized by adding another __data step__.

* Go back to the workflow main page by clicking on `Tutorial workflow`

\

* Click on `PCA results`

On the left side of the __projection__ you can see the results of the __PCA__ are available for visualization.

\
We visualized the data using PC1 and PC2, while coloring the species and sex of the crabs.\
Thanks to the drag and drop way of working in __tercen__ you can quickly and intuitively visualize the results of your data. 

Your data can be visualized in many ways using __tercen__ and every visualization can provide different insights. Next we will visualize the crabs_longformat using a pair-wise plot. 

* Click on `Tutorial workflow` to go back to the workflow page
* Click on `Pair-wise plot`

You will see the __projection__ of the __data step__, as seen in the image below.

\
In this __projection__ you can see that we visualized the differences between male and female, by coloring by sex.
In the columns you can appreciate that you can add multiple levels, differentiating between the species and the variables.

You now have an idea of the possibilities using __tercen__. For more information about how to upload and work with your own data, continue reading the getting started guide.
