# Visualize the result
In this section you visualize the output of your previous PCA computation. The visual uses two principal components in a pair-wise plot.

* Right click on the data step and select `Add` 

* Choose a `Data step` and click `OK`


* A new projection page opens. 
This projection page should be familiar as you have seen this before in the previous steps of the this guide. However you will notice there are additional factors in the factor list, namely `ds0.PC1`, `ds0.PC2`, etc..

First we require to empty the project by removing factors. Note a tiny x appears when the mouse is place over the factor to be removed (see red circle below).

* Remove `observation` from the column zone 
* Remove `variable` from the row zone
* Remove `ds0.PC1`  from the y-axis

The result view should be an empty projection

Now you create the required project by
* Drag-n-drop the ``ds0.PC2`` factor to the _x-axis zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``ds0.PC3`` factor to the _y-axis zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``sex`` and ``species`` factor to the _colors zone_

* Click on the crabs workflow page on the top bar, the presented workflow is:

* Right click on the Data step and select `Rename`
Rename it to "results"

* Save workflow by clicking on the save icon in the tope bar beside the `crabs workflow`
