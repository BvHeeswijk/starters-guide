# Compute
In this section you perform a computation by selecting an existing operator (PCA) and running it.


The projection you created in the previous section can also be used by a computation (i.e. __operator__).
This is due to the _What you see is what you compute_ paradigm. The following steps outlines how to add an __operator__.

In the cross-tab window we created in the previous chapter.
