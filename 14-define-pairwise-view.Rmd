# Visualize a pairwise
In this section you create a multi-group pairwise visual. A powerful visual.

* Click on the `crabs data` step and select **Add** 

* Choose a **Data step** and click **OK**
This will create a second data step and a new projection page opens.

We will now create a pairwise projection of the ``variable``.

* Drag-n-drop the ``measurement`` factor to the _y-axis zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``variable`` factor to the _column zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``variable`` factor to the _row zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``index`` factor to the _label zone_
Resize the project view by using putting the mouse over the row lines dragging the rows tighter, similarly for the columns. Once resized the view should look like:

This is a pairwise projection and it is a direct result of putting the same factor (i.e. ``variable``) on the row and column zone. However this projection can be further developed into multi-group pariwise.

* Drag-n-drop the ``sp`` factor to the _column zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``sex`` factor to the _color zone_

You have now completed the multi-group pairwise. This view is a powerful projection.

* Click on the crabs workflow page on the top bar

Your workflow should look like the following:

Note the new `Data step` you added previous got pasted ontop of previous step called `PCA`. We drag it to the side to show this.

* Drag the step called `Data step` to the right, it should now look like:

* Right click on the step called `Data step` and select **Rename**
Rename it to "pairwise"

* In the top bar, close all pages except the crab workflow page. 
* Click on the save icon beside the crab workflow page of the top bar
